This summary presents the development and implementation of an advanced predictive system designed to address key challenges in service management: forecasting SLA (Service Level Agreement) breaches and estimating the expected Time-to-Resolve (TTR) for service requests. Failures in managing resolution times can lead to significant operational and financial consequences. Therefore, a machine learning-based solution was developed to provide proactive insights, enabling real-time intervention.
The project was based on a comprehensive dataset of historical service requests from an internal company, stored in a MongoDB database. The dataset included a combination of structured data (like categories and dates) and unstructured data in free-text format (the request description). Our methodology involved a multi-stage data preprocessing pipeline, including text cleaning and data encoding, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets.
For model training, we focused on advanced ensemble models, specifically XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, for both the classification (SLA breach prediction) and regression (TTR prediction) tasks. The models underwent hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV to maximize their performance. Based on a set of tailored evaluation metrics, the XGBoost model consistently demonstrated the best performance, showing high accuracy in predicting SLA breaches and a low average error in forecasting time-to-resolve.
The results indicate that machine learning can be leveraged to provide a powerful management tool for data-driven decision-making, thereby improving operational efficiency, reducing SLA breaches, and enhancing the overall service experience.
